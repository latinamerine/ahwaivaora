                            <p>So I recently switched from MS office to Libreoffice and don't know where to go for help so I'm coming here. amp#x200B; I'm trying to move/copy a worksheet from one file/workbook to another, and in doing so I am selecting the move or copy command choosing the other file in the drop down menu and when I click the OK I get a fatal error and calc closes all files. I would do some research but the error message contains nothing except a yellow triangle with a black "!" with "Fatal Error" An XLS file is a spreadsheet file created by Microsoft Excel or exported by another spreadsheet program, such as OpenOffice Calc or Apple Numbers. It contains one or more worksheets, which store and display data in a table format. XLS files may also store mathematical functions, charts, styles, and formatting. I'm trying to find an OOTB solution to the following issue: I've got a document library in the many thousands. These are all grouped and associated with a unique ParentID, which is a managed property showing query and retrieve. I want to create an alert based on specific ParentID's, to show when documents associated with that ID are available for review. Normally I would use a list view and create an alert on that, but I'm limited to 10 ParentID's with OOTB SharePoint 2013 unless I make numerous.

I recently had to reinstall Microsoft Excel and when I did it changed all my files (over 800) to "XLS file" and I am trying to change them back to "Microsoft Excel Worksheet" file type. Is there a way to do more than one at a time or possibly a macro? Thank you in advance XLTX and XLTM File Formats. When an excel file is saved with either an XLTX or XLTM extension it is saved as a template file. Template files are intended to be used as starter files for new workbooks and they normally contain saved settings such as the default number of sheets per workbook, formatting, formulas, graphics. Hi guys, bit of a long shot but I've been trying to work on some data recovery. A raid array died and a drive in a striped volume was lost. My colleague has been able to rebuild the raid and recover most of the files, however we are finding that when trying to open certain files (mostly xls) we are presented with the error: "The file format and extension of ".xls" don't match. The file could be corrupted or unsafe. Unless you trust its source, don't open it. Do you want to open it anyway?".

Apologies if asked: I searched for this but didn't know exactly how to phrase it so didn't find much. I had an older version of excel and recently updated to 2016. I now try to open my Excel file and it opens a Save dialogue box (I can attach a screenshot if necessary). Then I save the excel and it again opens to a Save dialogue box. If I first open Excel blank (Programs-gtExcel2016) and go to Open from there, it opens the file fine. it seems to only be an issue when trying xls is a very common file extension used for spreadsheets created using Microsoft Excel 97-2003. This is the best spreadsheet solution available with desktop pushing capabilities. xls files contain tables, formulas, tables, images, text graphs, charts, page formatting, print settings and a lot more. xls was changed to xlsx after Microsoft. I got this software at job that exports data in excel files, this data needs to be processed and I am doing it with a macro the only problem is that some of these files (not all of them) are actually html files in .xls format so I get this error when I try to open them: gt The file you are trying to open, 'filename.xls', is in a different format than the specified by the file extension. Verify that the file is not corrupted and is from a trusted source before opening the file. File formats that are supported in Excel. You can save an Excel file in another file format by clicking the File > Save As. The file formats that are available in the Save As dialog box vary, depending on what type of sheet is active (a worksheet, chart sheet, or other type of sheet). Note: Whenever you save a file in another file format.  If I receive an Excel file, is it possible to deduce from a document property (or the like) which Excel edition that file was either last saved in (2003, 2010, 2013, etc) or / and what edition of Excel that file was first created in? I wouldn't be surprised if you can't as I'd guess that the file formats are built to be as compatible between Excel editions as possible Thanks very much in advance. I have to deal with a site that spits out a HUGE html file claiming it's xls. It's currently 60mb, but 4mb when converted properly to xlsx. I have vba to pull the proper xlsx into an access database, but before I can do that I have to open it and actually convert it from the underlying html to a true xlsx format. Is there any way I can programmatically do that? As time goes on and the file gets bigger.manually manipulating it is getting to be a chore. This is the weekly thread for development questions or chit-chat that doesn't belong in the Monday Beginner Questions thread. All questions/comments/ranting about Drupal dev is fair game.

Looking to convert hundreds of files and a tool would be very useful! Thanks. Apologies if this is a simple fix and has been asked before. I'm new to Python, finished the codeacademy course and I'm embarking on making my own programs to climb the rungs of difficulty in Python (though I'm not new to programming in general). Using PyCharm, my current goal is to make a script to sort the files in my Downloads folder into respective directories for each file type. The directory check and subsequent creation is working, however the error I'm getting occurs when it finds. So I want to create a batch file that finds the last file in a specific folder, and with an exact extension that I write in the batch file. This time is ".xls" extension. The question is: What is the last file in "/Documents" with a ".xls" extension? What do I do with this file?: Copy it to another folder. There's what I got for now: for /f "tokens= " %%a in ('dir /b /od') do set newest=%%a copy "%newest%". If this has been posted before then I apologize, but the search function isn't working for me right now. The title says it all. Whenever I have Excel 2010 running and I click a link in Opera to download an Excel file (choosing "Open" instead of "Save") then Windows opens up an entirely new instance of Excel rather than opening a new workbook in the already-running instance in Excel. I don't have this problem with IE, Firefox, or Chrome. Can anyone advise? I've not been able to fix it using.

I came across this sticky thread (https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/bbpgem/gatekeeping_megathread/) and I had to get this out of my system. I face senior data scientists at the consultancy startup I work for. Every day I face an issue or the other with them. TLDR: Number of years worked apparently makes a better impression than the knowledge you have. And many of them are just plain insecure. ### Data Scientist 1 My manager considers him as an expert in python because. 
6 months ago I made a similar post but it's now archived, so here's a newer version. I still add new links and get rid of dead ones so make sure to check back every now and then and let me know if something should be added! V.3 Update (2019/05/06): Added to Drum kits, changing dates to Y/M/D instead of M/D/Y, added to Books/other, moved LoVibe kits back to 'No longer on Sellfy kits' because they're gone again. Didn't get a chance to cop vol.3 but it was on their Selz page for a minute. Hey everyone! Happy day after Unbroken Bonds release day! I've updated the comprehensive English Pokémon TCG Checklist that I've been maintaining since the release of Primal Clash all the way back in 2015! As always, I thank you for your support and the users out there that help me so much with this huge task. A special shout out to /u/jab2004 who was the original creator and maintainer of this workbook. This update continues where 5.9 left off with support for Unboken Bonds and Detective. So i've just started playing with powershell, trying to learn to script some of my work. Simple task: Take files from Downloads and file them into Downloads$filetype$year I've kinda got the first part down: # Folders to scan $Directories = @{ 'DownloadsFolder' = "$env:USERPROFILE\Downloads\" } # Destination folder $DestinationRootFolder = "$env:USERPROFILE\Downloads" # Declare folder names and file extensions $Folders

Hi all, I found this macro to save a current worksheet in Excel to a specific file location as a PDF. The PDF should be titled what the original workbook was titled, but this macro is adding an unwanted ".xlsm" to the PDF title. Where the PDF should be titled "04 2019", it's now titled "04 2019.xlsm". I found this thread (https://www.ozgrid.com/forum/forum/help-forums/excel-general/115925-removing-file-extension-from-fileextstr-in-vba-already-have-code) where I believe they're trying to resolv. </p>
