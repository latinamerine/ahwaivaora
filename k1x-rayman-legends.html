Honestly, I was trawling through PS Plus games the other day and realised I‚Äôd never played a Rayman game. It‚Äôs so good! I don‚Äôt know I‚Äôve missed this series of games, having owned every PlayStation since PS1. I‚Äôm really enjoying playing a game I can pick and and play with no fuss that is challenging but not a 40 hour open world slog or online FPS. I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs underrated because I‚Äôve obviously never paid the franchise any attention. I think I thought it was a low rent Mario. Been playing this recently Such a good platformer. Score is great. Parallax scrolling back and foregrounds are on point. The way it unlocks the next worlds even if you don't üíØ the levels are fun (even though I go back and perfect each time). Level design is great. It teaches you a thing and then you go "Oh that's how I do that thing from last level!" So you go back and try again. Absolutely love it. Beautiful platformer. It's so cheap on PSN right now but could see it being a great handheld. Does anyone know if you can play online co-op on Rayman Legends. https://youtu.be/VJNj6fKLaQI (https://youtu.be/VJNj6fKLaQI). 
https://imgur.com/gallery/4IFemtT Got a Black P20 Pro 120gb used for about 3 weeks wanting to trade it for another phone or for money reason of sale cannot unlock bootloader and root No scratches brand new phone comes with spigen case and a bright red one. Also original box fast charger. Also have a Yellow UE Boom 2, Mario Odyssey and Rayman Legends for the switch Located in Blainville Quebec Canada can do local pickup. So I‚Äôve been playing Celeste ever since it came out and i don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll get bored of it. As great as it is, I wanted to see if there was another game that would be even close to as amazing as Celeste is. After mining through the eShop shovelware, I uncovered a hidden gem: Rayman Legends: Definitive Edition. It‚Äôs a side-scroller, like Celeste, but it looks more realistic, since instead of pixel art, they have hand-drawn animation, like Cuphead or Hollow Knight.

Timestamps ( Hey! So I have 4 Vita games I am looking to trade: Dragon Ball Z: Battle of Z Need for Speed: Most Wanted Injustice The Walking Dead Season 1 ~~Rayman Legends~~ ampnbsp; Interested in all CiB Vita offers but am specifically looking for: Danganronpa Sword Art Online: Hollow Fragment (English) Murimasa Rebirth. So many people calling it the best 2D platformer of this generation and one of the best platformers ever made, so i bought it on the PS Vita which supposed to be more fun because of the touch screen, but other than the musical levels and the final boss fight, nothing was that special and it felt pretty repetitive after a while (maybe because i tried to 100% the game). That would be just awesome. Even if it's just a digital download and no boxed.

I have seen in the eshop that this game is on sale and costs 14‚Ç¨ (~ ). Should I buy it? I'm traveling next week and it would be nice to have a fun game for the plane. https://i.imgur.com/YskrY7P.jpg This is my first contribution here so please go easy if I mess this up. I go to Target every weekend for specific grocery shopping but always check the clearance end cap. Rayman Legends Definitive has been  on clearance for the past few weeks I've gone but today it is now .98. YMMV depending on the Target but two of my local locations have it for that price, while others are showing  and . Here is a Brickseek link so you can look for yourself. </p>
