                            <p> I've been clearing out my storage locker. I found a huge number of old Mac parts that have been collecting dust. Among them were four PRAM batteries -- even though the date on them is from 2004, all four tested at over 3.6V. I plopped one in my old G3 Tower, and after it complained about the time being wrong, it's keeping time so that's why I've only got three left. :) I'll ship these to anywhere in the US amp Canada for the cost of postage, I suspect somewhere between -5 depending. I just installed Civ 5 on my new MacBook and I noticed there is no antialiasing option. I feel like when I was on my last MacBook, there was an option for this. If it was there, where did it go and how can I bring it back? Also, does anyone know how to add new fullscreen resolutions? There's no 1680x1050 option, and that's what I want to use. There is for some reason 1650x1050 but that leaves annoying black boxes on the sides of the screen. Any help would be appreciated. Thanks. At the time of writing this post, Avengers Endgame has released in select countries and will eventually hit theatres worldwide on the 26th of April. Make sure you have your tickets booked and ready and also double check everything before heading out to the cinemas! Now, The movie had its world premiere in LA about two days ago and the media embargo got lifted yesterday, some early reactions hit social media and so far, it's been very positive!

Well, I’m on here again, to ask for advice. The last time I posted a question, you Redditors were super responsive! I wasn’t able to follow any advice, though, because things got…complicated. You see, I’m pretty sure my boyfriend somehow saw what I posted, even though I posted my question under a throwaway account, with absolutely no details tying me to my real identity. Even the ages I used were fake. In case you forgot, this was my question: I (18F) really miss spending quality Happy Easter all. Inspired by two previous posts ( here (https://redd.it/44n4lr) and here (https://redd.it/8yk4qa)) I thought I'd carry on the tradition, cheeky post name included.

I'll just start by saying up front that this is not a minimalist pack. I'd call myself a pretty seasoned ultralight backpacker, but currently my priorities are a little different. I've been on the road since September with my girlfriend, working remotely for a software agency back in the US.

Pics of my bag and layout (https://imgur.com/a/hMXQIkk) I promised to post the specifics of my bag as a retort to the silliness and fucktardery. I am a man of my word. Critique away. My bag weighs 21.53 lbs. w/ a full canteen according to the scale at the local general store. I don’t know if that’s 100% accurate but it feels right. I’ve carried this bag for many miles. It’s the result of years of trial and error. Bag · Arcteryx Khard 30 (so called because its 30 liters). I would. My last (and only) iPhone was the 3G, loved that thing - until I didn't.

I decided to make this post as I ran into a few stumbling blocks when trying to remove/sidestep my ATampT provided Pace 5268ac router for my ATampT fiber connection. This is a culmination of some info already provided and that is abundantly available and some info that is assumed by most guides but wasn't exactly intuitive (to me, at least).

I want to make a song for graduating high school, and I don't necessarily listen to normal people music, I usually listen to High Quality Video Game Rips (thanks /r/GiIvaSunner) Any suggestions? songs that give you a happy+sad feeling can work too.

I've been a hardcore Mac user for as long as I can remember, having the first original all white Macbook when it first came out. I've never had an issue with any of them (I think I've had two) and they've both lasted 4-6 years. Just this January I bought the new Macbook 2018 version and I've been having so many issues with it and I'm feeling incredibly frustrated. It took me probably 10x as long (no joke) to type this post because of the horrific keyboard.

Here I've got the same problem. I guess I am doing something wrong within config. SRX's are directly connected. Example: 2 VLAN's (tag): 10, 20 Each vlan is reffering to irb interface. IRB interfaces have configured IP addresses. IRB interfaces are assigned to a zone trust. Traffic from zone trust to trust is allowed, also host-inbound-traffic.
